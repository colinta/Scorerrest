Scorerrest
==========

Scorerrest is a board/dice/card/social game scoring app.

Usage:

- You should start with the big green "+" button, and add the people you play games with.  Then select the people playing, in the order you are playing in.
- You can use the -5/-1/+1/+5 buttons to quickly add up that player's score, then hit "OK" to add that score to the current player.
- You can tap a player to make them "current".
- Use the keypad (123 button) to type out any score, especially useful to assign large scores, like for Farkle where scores can get ridiculous.
- Use the memory feature (M+) to add up scores for the current player, useful for games that have lots of ways to get points, like Triominoes, Cribbage, and Klabberjass.
- Use the undo (⤺) or restart buttons (⟲) to modify the history.

Enjoy!
