Scorerrest
==========

Scorerrest is a board/dice/card/social game scoring app.

You will still need to *own* these games in order to play them, Scorerrest only
scores, it is not a game in and of itself.

The tally feature is the handiest, since most games involve scoring points of
*some* kind, and you can easily adapt it to other games.  The other scoring apps
are for convenience or fun.
